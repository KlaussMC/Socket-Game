  h1 The game communication

    .inlineCode
    | #{title} makes use of virtual tunnels that stream data to and from destinations, called websockets. 
    | There is a central listener at the document tree's root called 
    .inlineCode socket.js 
    | and it's job is to process all of these sockets through aid of a library called 
    i socket.io.
    br
    | Every time the game is accessed, the client (your browser) sends a message to the listener and tells it to register the player.
    | Once it is registered, it decides what the size of the map will be. 
    br
    | It will always be 5 times the size of the smallest screen.
    | The game starts and each client enters the 
    i Loop 
    | phase. 
    br 
    | During this phase, a loop is executed that sends the player's position to the listener, which forwards it to the other clients so that they can display an enemy player.
    br
    | The clients also share their rover and projectile information with each other so that the user can see what is happening.
    br
    br
    | Everything that a client sends is in the form of a JavaScript object, which is a collection of 
    .inlineCode Key:Value 
    | pairs. The messages are identifyable by names that the programmer has provided. 
    | #{title} has a few of these that perform certain tasks, 
    | for example, the clients have a specialised message listener for text messages that the other player has sent. (Open the player command menu and enter your message prefaced by a hashtag)
    br
    | But the clients also have other, more useful messengers available, such as 
    .inlineCode evalEnemy 
    | which will execute certain code on the enemy clients.
    .code
      .orange socket
      .red .
      .orange emit
      .blue (
      .green "evalEnemy"
      .red , 
      .green "notify('hello')"
      .blue )
      .red ;
    | This simply displays a notification on the opponent with the content of 
    .inlineCode hello
    | .
    br
    | As well as communication, these messengers can also be used to instruct the enemies to end the game when a player dies.
